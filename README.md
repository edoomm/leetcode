# Leetcode
Here you'll find daily problems I'll be resolving, divided into 3 categories:
- [Easy](/src/easy/)
- [Medium](/src/medium/)
- [Hard](/src/hard/)

The goal is to resolve a problem once a day, for the toughest ones I'll be resolving them within 2-3 days (as I am just dedicating myself to a 30-minute leetcode routine), and the tougher than the toughest ones I'll look for a solution online haha. When I get better at this, I hope I'll be resolving two problems per day and so on(:

You can find a [docs](/docs/) folder (since I am a documentation addict) where you can find how to run files and so.
